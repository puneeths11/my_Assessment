# Puneeth Assessment Project

This repository contains the code for the Level 2Assessment Level 2 project. The goal was to create a product card with specific data elements, implement tab switching functionality, calculate the percentage off using JavaScript, and integrate basic Shopify page functionality.

## Features Implemented

- **Product Card:**

  - Displayed product information including image, badge, product title, vendor, price, and compare at price.
  - Calculated the percentage off using JavaScript.

- **Tab Switching:**

  - Implemented tab switching functionality for "Men," "Women," and "Kids" tabs.
  - Updated the displayed product cards dynamically based on the selected tab.

- **Add to Cart Button:**

  - Created a visual "Add to Cart" button.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensured a user-friendly interface with responsiveness for both mobile and desktop devices.

## API Fetch and Data Retrieval

- **Dynamic Content through API:**

  - Implemented an API fetch request to retrieve product data dynamically.
  - a Shopify API to fetch relevant product details, such as product image, title, vendor, price, and compare at price.

- **Data Parsing and Integration:**
  - Performed data parsing to extract necessary information from the API response.
  - Integrated the retrieved data seamlessly into the product cards, ensuring that the displayed information remains up-to-date and reflects changes on the server.

## DOM Manipulation

- **DOM Manipulation:**

  - Employed DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically update the product cards and other relevant elements based on the fetched data.
  - Ensured a smooth user experience by dynamically adjusting content without requiring a full page reload.

- **Interactive User Interface:**

  - Implemented interactive features using DOM manipulation, such as highlighting selected tabs, updating the cart count, and providing real-time feedback on user interactions.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Incorporated error-handling mechanisms for API requests; any errors that occur are printed in the console window.
